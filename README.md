Hi there! I'm Ezra, a Master of Electrical and Space Systems Engineering student at Kyushu Institute of Technology. I am interested in applying ML and AI techniques to nanosatellites.

## Projects

- [VERTECS Nanosatellite Project](https://vertecs-project.com/) - This mission seeks to investigate star formation history by observing the cosmic background radiation using a 6U-size nanosatellite with a small-aperture telescope.
- [GalaxyClassification](https://github.com/ezrafielding/GalaxyClassification) - Attempting to classify galaxy morphology using various supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques.


## Education

- Master of Engineering - Electrical and Space Systems Engineering, [Kyushu Institute of Technology](https://www.kyutech.ac.jp/english/) (October 2022 to Present)
- Bachelor of Science Honors - Computer Science, [University of the Western Cape](https://www.uwc.ac.za/) (February 2021 to December 2021)
- Bachelor of Science - Computer Science, [University of the Western Cape](https://www.uwc.ac.za/) (February 2018 to December 2020)
